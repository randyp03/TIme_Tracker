# Time_Tracker

## This a manual time tracker using python and json

### Main program functions

- Run the main.py file and it will ask to add or end an activity
- "add {{activity}}" will get the start time for the activity
- "end {{activity}}" will get the end time for the activity
- Program will not add activity to json file until user enters "end {{activity}}"
- User can choose to quit the program by typing 'quit app' instead
- Once the application is ended, program will print the total time elapsed for each activity

### Future improvements
- Add TKinter GUI for an easier look to program is one goal
- Manually creating entries can get annoying, so making the program automatic is also a goal
